# 🗂️ Week 3: Introduction to Databases & SQL

## Overview
In the third week, I learned about databases and how they are used to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently. I was introduced to SQL (Structured Query Language) and practised writing basic queries to retrieve, filter, and organise data. This helped me understand how databases support structured data analysis and decision-making.
